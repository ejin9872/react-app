# GitHub Setup Guide for React To-Do App

## Step 1: Complete Git Installation

If Git commands are not working, please:

1. **Download Git for Windows**: https://git-scm.com/download/windows
2. **Run the installer** and make sure to select "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software"
3. **Restart VS Code** completely
4. **Open a new terminal** in VS Code

## Step 2: Configure Git (First Time Setup)

Run these commands in the terminal (replace with your info):

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Step 3: Initialize Git Repository

```bash
cd c:\Users\emilyjin\myProjects\ReactApp\react-app
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: React To-Do App with TypeScript

Features:
‚úÖ Add, edit, delete, and toggle tasks
üîç Filter tasks (all, active, completed)  
üíæ Local storage persistence
üì± Responsive design with modern UI
üß™ Comprehensive test suite
‚ö° TypeScript support"
```

## Step 4: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click "New" repository
3. Repository name: `react-todo-app`
4. Description: `A modern React TypeScript to-do application with local storage and responsive design`
5. Keep it Public
6. DON'T initialize with README (we have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 5: Connect to GitHub

After creating the GitHub repo, run:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react-todo-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 6: Create Pull Request (Optional)

If you want to create a PR for collaboration:

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/initial-todo-app`
2. Push the branch: `git push -u origin feature/initial-todo-app`
3. Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request from the branch to main
